After learning the ropes as a mechanic, he ventured out starting his first automotive shop in 1996 with $4,000, a used hoist, floor jack and lots of naive determination. Six years later, he profited through the sale of that business, and in 2004 opened Desert Car Care of Chandler in Chandler, Arizona.
Desert Car Care expanded to a second location in 2009 and a third in 2012. Both were sold in 2013 to focus on the Chandler operation which grew to become a nationally recognized and award-winning seven-bay, top 1% national gross revenue automotive repair shop.
