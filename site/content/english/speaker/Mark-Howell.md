Mark began repairing appliances at his mother's appliance business at the age of 12. The experience served him well and he used it to start a career in refrigeration sales and serivce. This led to a stint in logistics, seeing opportunities when trying to solve his own shipping struggles.

After spending a decade with Frito Lay, first as a diesel technician, then as regional exper trainer, Mark moved on to start a mobile repair business for heavy equipment gaining experience with many of the vendors and suppliers he teaches about today.

In his free time Mark enjoys playing hockey (could've been a pro), riding his Harley, and taking on impressive automotive restoration projects ranging from muscle cars to British tanks.
